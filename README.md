## Meadows Unlimited Group Project 3
* Chelsea Chaussee
* Sandy Goodell
* Chia Sun

## Taking Ownership
* visualizations (Chia)
  * Use fake dataset - possibly have one js file to be a stationary map, then another for interactivity for dropdown to change per path/route.
* Flask app
* database

Use fake datasets on each portion to start building out to minimize the waiting for one person or another to finish their portion.


### Requirements
(Must Include All of the following)
* A Python Flask - powered API
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* One Database (SQL, MongoDB, SQlite, etc.)

### Feature
(either/or)
* D3.js visualization or
* Multiple leaflet, plotly, or other D3 wrapper type visualization

### Dataset
(can come from)
* Single source or multiple sources - at least 100 records in final form
* Web Scraping, API calls, or csvs that have been ETL's into your database, and live API calls

### Specific Requirements
1. Website must include at least one Javascript library not covered in class
2. Must have interactivity:
* Must be able dynamically change some aspect of the page
* Accomplish this with inputs, buttons, or menus
3. Website should allow for three distinct views of your data:
* If building one dynamic D3.js visualization, might have aspects of the change based on user input, allowing for at least three different views
* If building a dashboard of multiple visualizatio, have a least three different visualizations that can be plots, charts, graphs or maps. With still having to work in some interactivity.

Strava API


# Ideas
* Drop down menu selecting a specific path
* Changes a stacked chart for each day of the week for how many people (men vs women) running during each day of the week
* Highcharts - packed bubbles (use the JFiddle)
  * Use paths or zip codes and change the bubble sizes depending on miles that path contains
  * Use the js file to help understand how to structure the MongoDB transform
* Mapbox map out route
